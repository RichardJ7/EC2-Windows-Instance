<h2>Description</h2>
The lab was intended to provision an instance within a cloud environment for practice using Windows related services. The cloud platofrm utilized was AWS, specifically EC2. This lab is predicated on a preexisting account in AWS, to permit access to different evironments. Additionally, this lab helped gain familiarity with working within a cloud environment. <br/>

<h2>EC2 Provision Steps </h2> 
As previously mentioned, this lab could not be completed without the creation of an AWS account. Upon creation of the account, the instance I will be using to create this Windows environment is EC2. I wanted to ensure that the environment would run smoothly, so I increased the instance type from the default.
